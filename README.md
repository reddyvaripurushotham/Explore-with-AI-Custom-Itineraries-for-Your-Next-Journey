# Explore with AI: Custom Itineraries for Your Next Journey

## Project Description
AI Travel Planner generates customized travel itineraries using Google Gemini AI model.
The AI Travel Planner is a Generative Artificial Intelligence-based application designed to generate personalized travel itineraries automatically. The system uses the Google Gemini 1.5 Pro pre-trained model to create structured and detailed travel plans based on user inputs.
In today’s digital era, planning a trip requires extensive research. Travelers often spend hours browsing travel blogs, watching videos, and reading reviews to create a proper schedule. Organizing destinations, activities, food suggestions, and travel tips into a day-wise structured plan is a challenging and time-consuming task.
This project solves the problem by integrating Generative AI to automatically generate well-organized travel itineraries within seconds.
- The user simply provides:
- Destination
- Number of travel days
- The system processes the request using the Gemini AI model and generates:
- Day-wise itinerary
- Morning activities
- Afternoon activities
- Evening plans
- Food recommendations
- Travel tips
-The application demonstrates the real-world implementation of AI model integration using Python and API-based architecture.

## Project Objective
The main objectives of this project are:
- To implement Generative AI in a real-world application.
- To integrate Google Gemini API with Python.
- To generate dynamic and structured travel itineraries.
- To reduce manual effort in travel planning.
- To understand prompt engineering and AI response structuring.
- To develop API-based application architecture.

## Security Practices
- API keys are stored securely using environment variables (.env file).
- The .env file and venv folder are excluded using .gitignore.
- No sensitive information or API keys are uploaded to GitHub.
- The project follows secure API integration practices.
- Only required files are committed to the repository

## Use Cases
- Personalized travel itinerary generation
- Travel and tourism assistance
- Quick trip planning for students and professionals
- Business travel schedule planning
- Vacation planning without manual research
- Smart travel recommendation systems

## Conclusion
The AI Travel Planner demonstrates how Generative AI can be effectively applied to simplify travel planning. By integrating the Google Gemini 1.5 Pro model with Python, the system generates structured and personalized travel itineraries instantly.
The project reflects:
* Real-world AI model integration
* API-based application development
* Secure coding practices
* Practical implementation of Generative AI
* Scalable and user-friendly design
*This project is suitable for academic submission and internship evaluation as it demonstrates both technical implementation and structured documentation.
